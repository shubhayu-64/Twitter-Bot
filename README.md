Twitter-Bot is an automation bot using Selenium Automation Framework with python. This replaces the use of Twitter API as it is costly and takes much time to get access to. You can use it to post tweets, retweet based on keyword and like tweets on the homepage or like tweets based on keywords. 

## How to Install

1. Create a ```python``` virtual environment. 
2. Clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/shubhayu-64/Twitter-Bot.git``` or download the repository.
3. Go to the cloned/downloaded directory ``` cd Twitter-Bot ``` 
4. Run ``` pip3 install selenium ``` and ``` pip3 install webdriver_manager```
5. And now you can run the example scripts or create your own scripts.  

## Usage
- To like tweets on the homepage, run ``` python3 homepage_tweets_like.py```
- To like tweets based on keyword, run ``` python3 keyword_tweets_like.py```
- To post a tweet, run ``` python3 post_tweet.py```
- To retweet based on keyword, run ``` python3 keyword_tweets_retweet.py```

## FAQ
- How to stop the script? Ctrl+C (control+C for Mac) 
- Script opens browser and nothing happens? Try checking the terminal. It might be asking for credentials.
- For any other problems, feel free to raise an issue.

## What next?
