1. Create a ```python``` virtual environment.
2. Clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/shubhayu-64/Twitter-Bot.git ``` 
3. Go to the cloned directory ``` cd Twitter-Bot ```
4. Run ``` pip3 install selenium ``` and ``` pip3 install geckodrivermanager```
5. And now you can run the example scripts or create your own scripts.
